    <p1>Hey everyone! My name is Carter Frederickson and I am from Herndon, Virginia! I am currently studying software engineering and am taking this class as part of that major! Learning about web design will help me a lot in that field!</p1> 
    <p2>What I love most about BYUI is the environment here. I love how committed it is to the gospel and strengthening our testimonies! </p2>
    <p3>I have been a member my whole life and I love it! My favorite scripture comes from 2 Nephi 31:20 "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."</p3>
